# Desk Utils

A collection of scripts I made to help with common tasks like file organization or backup.

## Caracter√≠stics
- Designed to work with Bash only.
- Simple to use.
- Follows the UNIX philosophy, as each utility is self contained and responsible for a specific task.

## TODO

[] Implement file organization.<br>
[] Implement file backups.
